# <p align="center">**<u>Neo Blockchain App</u>**</p>

### **Description:** Demo Neo Blockchain Application for Senior Design at Florida Polytechnic University. 

#### **Code Organization:** 

- index.html: driver html for the dApp front-end. Shows a button to the user. When the button is pressed, it shows the result "World" along with the current block that has been generated on the blockchain. In addition, the user can upload a PDF file which is converted to base64, then back to PDF form and shown to the user. This functionality will eventually be used and store the encrypted base64 PDF string on the Blockchain for later retrieval.
  

#### **Code Building:** 

- N/A: N/A.



#### **Team Contributions:**

- Matthew Dutchess (Team Lead): Blockchain Creation, Blockchain Initialization, Smart Contract Creation, Front-End Development.

- Calvin Hariprasad: N/A.

- Cameryn Costanzo: N/A.

  

#### **Imported Libraries:** 

- neo3-boa: Boa is a platform that allows us to quickly write, compile, and test smart contracts for the Neo blockchain using python.
- Neo-Express: A private blockchain network optimized for development scenarios. It locally mimics the behavior of the Neo network. We’ll use it as a development tool to deploy and interact with our smart contracts as if they were running on Neo’s MainNet, but without paying GAS for each interaction.
- neon-js: A powerful JavaScript SDK for the Neo blockchain that provides a lightweight library focused on blockchain interactions.
