# <p align="center">**<u>Neo Blockchain App</u>**</p>

### **Description:** Demo Neo Blockchain Application for Senior Design at Florida Polytechnic University. 

#### **Code Organization:** 

- index.html: driver html for the dApp front-end. Shows a button to the user. When the button is pressed, it shows the result "World" along with the current block that has been generated on the blockchain.
  

#### **Code Building:** 

- N/A: N/A.



#### **Team Contributions:**

Note: all team members worked and contributed as equally as possible with coding and researching for what we needed for this project. For formality's sake, here is a list of team members and what we are each contributing:

- Matthew Dutchess (Team Lead): Blockchain Creation, Blockchain Initialization, Smart Contract Creation, Front-End Development.

  

#### **Imported Libraries:** 

- neo3-boa: Boa is a platform that allows us to quickly write, compile, and test smart contracts for the Neo blockchain using python.
- Neo-Express: A private blockchain network optimized for development scenarios. It locally mimics the behavior of the Neo network. We’ll use it as a development tool to deploy and interact with our smart contracts as if they were running on Neo’s MainNet, but without paying GAS for each interaction.
- neon-js: A powerful JavaScript SDK for the Neo blockchain that provides a lightweight library focused on blockchain interactions.
